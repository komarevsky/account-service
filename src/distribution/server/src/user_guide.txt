This document describes how to use Account Service (Server part)

Server part of Account Service contains Web-GUI which is available for user after application is deployed on Application Server.
To see GUI open browser and follow the link:
    http://<Application-server-ip-address>[:<appServerPort>]/account-service/
Here is example for Tomcat running on the same machine where browser is:
    http://localhost:8080/account-service/

GUI consists of:
1. main page - contains link of statistics page and tips for client part
2. statistics page - this page shows values of counters (see section Counters) and gives possibility to perform operations on counters:
   store - stores values of counters in logs (see section Logs)
   reset - resets values of counters to zero


=========================
Counters
=========================
The following counters are presented:
1. CurrentlyServedGetAmount - number of getAmount invocations that are currently being served
2. CurrentlyServedAddAmount - number of addAmount invocations that are currently being served
3. TotalCallsGetAmount - number of invocations of getAmount method
4. TotalCallsAddAmount - number of invocations of addAmount method


=========================
Logs
=========================
Account service uses Log4j library for storing logs.
Logs are stored at ${catalina.home}/logs/account-service.log
To redefine default log configuration refer to Application Server documentation


=========================
Hibernate
=========================
Account Service uses Hibernate library to communicate with database.
If default hibernate.cfg.xml (packed in application) is overwritten, then new configuration has only one restriction:
it must contain
    <mapping class="com.freebetbot.as.service.account.Account"/>
in <session-factory> section
